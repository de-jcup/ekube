== EKube Model

The model is a complete separated from the used client technology for
connecting with kubernetes!

At the moment we will use https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client 
which brings up a very good API and seems to be state of the art for
connection.

There exist model builders which know used technology and build 
an ekube model. The model and its element do NOT know anything about
the kuberenetes client apis etc.

The model builder is able to register actions on each created 
EKubeElement implementation by action identifiers. The element knows
its action can trigger them. Inside the action there will be dedicated
libary/client dependent code.

So we got a full seperation between model and logic/tech stack.
