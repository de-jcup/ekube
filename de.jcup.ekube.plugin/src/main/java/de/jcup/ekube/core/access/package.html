<h1>This package is the core access layer to kubernetes.</h1>
Why another layer?
<br><br>
Reason: K8jc (KubernetesJavaClient) is a generated API which could change in future.
Also there is the danger that we must use different API calls in different versions to get all 
interesting stuff from kubernetes. So this abstraction layer makes absolute sense. (e.g. K8jcNamespace could 
be filled by using stable + experimental API calls).

Also using interfaces makes it much more easier to write mockito tests...
